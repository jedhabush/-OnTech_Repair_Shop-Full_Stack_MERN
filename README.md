## Description
A small computer/electronics repair shop would like to optimize the way they do things manually. Currently OnTech shop is using sticky notes to write the customer's name, the required repair, the employee in charge of repairing the device and any other related notes. The shop owner would like to have a web application to reduce manual errors, increase staff productivity and organization. The shop owner would like to implement the following:

**User Stories** <br/>
1- A public facing page with basic contact info <br/>
2- An employee login to the notes app <br/>
3- Display current user and assigned role <br/>
4- Provide a logout option <br/>
5- Require users to login at least once per week <br/>
6- Provide a way to remove employee access asap if needed <br/>
7- Notes are assigned to specific employees <br/>
8- Notes have a ticket #, title, note body, created & updated dates <br/>
9- Notes are either OPEN or COMPLETED <br/>
10- Users can be Employees, Managers, or Admins <br/>
11- Notes can only be deleted by Managers or Admins <br/>
12- Anyone can create a note (when customer checks-in) <br/>
13- Employees can only view and edit their assigned notes <br/>
14- Managers and Admins can view, edit, and delete all notes <br/>
15- Only Managers and Admins can access User Settings <br/>
16- Only Managers and Admins can create new users <br/>
17- Desktop mode is essential but should be available in mobile as well <br/>
